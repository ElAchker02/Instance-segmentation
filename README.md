<b>Project Overview</b>

This project implements an instance segmentation application leveraging the YOLOv8 model. Instance segmentation not only detects objects within images but also delineates each object at the pixel level, providing precise segmentation masks. This application processes images, videos, or live streams to detect and segment individual objects effectively.

<b>Features</b>
- Instance Segmentation: Accurately identifies and segments individual objects within images and videos using the YOLOv8 model.
- Real-Time Processing: Supports live stream input for real-time object detection and segmentation.
- Pre-trained Models: Utilizes state-of-the-art pre-trained YOLOv8 models for efficient and accurate segmentation.
